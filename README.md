<h1>Alarmify</h1>

<p>Alarmify is an iOS application for those who have trouble getting up to their normal, boring alarm clocks using your Spotify playlists. Waking up should be fun.</p>

Alarmify works for both Spotify free and premium users!


<h1>Core Features</h1>

  <li>Great UI and UX for simple and straightforward use, guaranteed to be your next and last alarm clock app you'll ever need.
  <li>Less cranky mornings because the only alarm tone you've listened to at 9 in the morning is "By the Seaside".</li>
</ul>

<h1>Target Users</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>People who have become accustom to default alarm tones and require something unique each morning to wake up on time</li>
    <li>People who want to move away from the default iOS alarm clock app and try something new</li>
